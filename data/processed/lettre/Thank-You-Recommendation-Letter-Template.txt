Date _______________ 
 
Dear _______________ [Individual’s Name], 
 
 
I am writing you today to show my deepest gratitude for your letter of recommendation. Your 
comments specifically enthused the management at _______________ [Enter Where 
Letter Was Sent] and, as a result, I have been employed by their organization. Without 
your reference, I sincerely believe I would not have had the edge over the other 
applicants and therefore would not have been hired. If there is anything I can do to 
repay the kind words expressed in your letter do not ever hesitate to ask. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
_______________ [Your Signature]

Dear _______________ [Individual’s Name], 
 
 
It is with sincere gratitude that I write this letter today for the reference you provided to 
_______________ [Enter Where Letter Was Sent]. If it weren’t for your gracious letter of 
recommendation I do not believe I would have stood out quite as much from the other 
candidates as many of whom I feel were more qualified than myself.  
 
I know you have a busy schedule and it means a lot to have someone of your stature 
write such an impactful letter. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any way I 
can repay this debt of appreciation. 
 
Sincerely,
